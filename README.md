This is the Customer Comms project.

The Customer Driver Communications Service (CDCS) is an API developed to allow delivery drivers to communicate
with customers for the duration of a delivery. There are several features such as anonymous messaging,
simultaneous active conversations, saving chat logs, and a status dashboard that enable the functionalities of this
service. We introduce this product to reduce complaint calls to THD call centers regarding logistical issues in
delivering orders to customers.


Make sure to include a .env file with the Twilio account SID and auth token
