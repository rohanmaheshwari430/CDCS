**Customer Driver Communications Service**
Developed by Rohan Maheshwari, Jenny Gibson, and Elan Grossman under The Home Depot OrangeWorks Innovation Lab.

The Customer Driver Communications Service (CDCS) is an API developed to allow delivery drivers to communicate
with customers for the duration of a delivery. There are several features such as anonymous messaging,
simultaneous active conversations, saving chat logs, and a status dashboard that enable the functionalities of this
service. We introduce this product to reduce complaint calls to THD call centers regarding logistical issues in
delivering orders to customers.
